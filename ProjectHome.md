Includes an addon which can export all gear in your inventory (and optionally your bank).  Given the saved variables output, this information can be merged with a character export XML file from Rawr to provide a more complete picture of your character without having to manually provide information about your available gear.

This project uses Lua, Groovy, and the Google App Engine.
